Continuation with Railway.

Turned out I was wrong with dates, not 5 days but 3 days. Between when I noticed something wrong and wrote to them, two days passed. Apparently got wound up and perceived the situation not very objectively and mentally was already preparing to move to Heroku. In general, today guys from Railway wrote a response: "Done, I've removed 2FA for you, and gave you some credits - really sorry for the delay here" and threw $20 to the balance. Damn pleasant for them and unpleasant for myself, because in the ticket I wrote this morning, "come on guys it's been 5 days already", now awkward. But apparently Railway is again my favorite, nothing changed, everyone disperse)
