Yesterday wrote that there's no fear, turns out it came with a delay :D

Today we broke down plans and tasks for the next sprint and I was pleasantly shocked by the coolness of tasks that guys from my team take to work. On the other hand, imposter syndrome really kicked in - will I pull such a level? On Monday I'll work on the first task from the list of 8 that need to be done by me.

At the end of the work day took one and decided to check what needs to be done there. The search result led me to library code in dependencies, not main code, will need to dig deeper and that's already left for Monday.

In general, a lot of cool stuff will happen inside the team in terms of development, I'm looking forward to it.

Today also had a call with the team lead and manager, plus standup and plans, total calls came out to about 3+ hours, I think in recent months I've gotten a bit unused to this. Because no matter how pleasant the communication is, my social battery drains and then I want to lie face down in a pillow.

From interesting: got acquainted on Mac with such a thing as Stage Manager (window management became much more convenient) +1 to understanding and accepting macOS.
