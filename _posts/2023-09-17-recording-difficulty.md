On Saturday tried to record YouTube videos about whether to go study programming and about my path from starting learning to getting an offer. Eventually, spent about 5 hours on recording.

Wrote a plan in advance about what to talk about, but the problem is that if I read from paper, I start getting nervous, and if I try to improvise, I start going off topic.

In general, talking to camera is a problem for me. Eventually, voice got tired and started getting hoarse, so I just stopped.
