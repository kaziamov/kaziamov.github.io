Well, here are the results of week 6 at the new job. Last week there was a call with the manager and team lead about the probation period. The feedback was good, just need to keep up the pace and continue in the same spirit. My personal statistics: 12 closed tasks since onboarding started. Two more are still in progress.

By the way, a conclusion I made recently is that I'm lucky with team leads, this time is no exception. Something that impressed me personally - this week the team lead wrote a CRM for a neighboring project in 4 days, which was pretty powerful. Now it's up to the devops to roll it out to production.

Mac on M4 lags during Google Meet calls + PyCharm. Not sure what needs to be done to make it fly, but so far on basic tasks it's not even at i7 level. In short, I want a Mac, but not on ARM.

Realized that working with Django projects is easier for me than doing test tasks and pet projects with it. Too much fiddling with configs and boilerplate code. Deploying FastAPI applications will be simpler. Django settings look ugly compared to pydantic settings. In a ready project, this stage is skipped and you can just extend functionality, so I prefer that more.

A program I discovered - Insomnia, it's like Postman, only looks lighter. On Ubuntu, the latest update actually froze completely, which is why I stopped using it.

Noticed that I'm neglecting blog and YouTube content again. There's a lot to tell, but the choice goes in favor of rest and time for myself. Reading books is much faster if you don't make content about how you read books and what thoughts you take away. But you can write feedback in comments about what needs to be written and it will wake me from hibernation.
