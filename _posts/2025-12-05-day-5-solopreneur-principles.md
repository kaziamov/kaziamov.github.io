Today I watched a couple of videos where solopreneurs shared their development approaches. The main idea is that you need to control your profit and avoid spending money on infrastructure (expensive cloud servers and subscription services you can live without). This makes sense to me, and I will follow this approach.

The second point that comes from this is the "marketing first" approach, which helps you focus on the product itself. First, you check if there is real demand for the product, and only then you start actual development. The technical part won't be as difficult for me compared to marketing. I agree with this and will apply it.

The third point is that I will probably need to buy something running macOS. Many apps that would be useful for me exist only for Mac. My Lenovo with Linux, even though I really like it, will only be good for development. For everything else, like promotion and content creation, Mac clearly has better software.

## Plan for tomorrow:
- Write down all the app ideas I have in my head that could be useful for me personally.
- Then I need to calculate my current expenses to make everything transparent (subscriptions, servers, and so on).
- Set up a blog and move all my posts from Telegram (where I tried to run a blog). I'll record this as a video, and maybe this will become my first service. It doesn't look like too much work (backend, a couple of interface pages, and one integration). But I might be wrong. Anyway, the video will be on YouTube next week.
