A bit of pain. My favorite Railway is dragging me for 5 days with account access recovery. I had a phone problem and I can't get 2FA keys. Although this wasn't even the problem, the problem was a payment that didn't go through and all my services went down. In general, on stream I wanted to use them again and say how great they are, and by the next stream I'll most likely be deploying to another service already, because well, don't do it like this.
