While writing the previous post, I understood such a thought - switching to backend development is a good idea because to start learning, any laptop will do, even the most ancient and hairy. For the duration of training it will be enough for any tasks, yes, comfort may differ from starting characteristics, but in general it will work. If not for a work project with 470 thousand lines of code, I probably wouldn't have thought that a code editor needs more than 2GB RAM.

So compared to design, where powerful processors and graphics cards with loads of memory and monitors are required, here you can write code even in notepad, other goodies only add comfort and speed.

So yes, backend is awesome.
