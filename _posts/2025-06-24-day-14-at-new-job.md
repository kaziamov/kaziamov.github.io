The first regular task I'm working on has dragged on. The MR shows it was created 5 days ago, quite a while. Access permissions, clarifying details, time to figure things out - typical work work. But still, I somehow expect more from myself.

While working on the task, I got acquainted with ClickHouse and Protobuf, and Python wrappers for them. And refactored part of the code with configuration, as I see it was starting to develop in the wrong direction (said the guy who's only on his second week on the project). Also thought that after Pydantic, all these serializers in Django look bulky, and wanted to drag it into the project, but I won't do that, of course.

Praised PyCharm in previous posts that it can be run even on a bucket, but it started hanging on me with certain regularity. Now the question is whether it's the Mac or the new version 25.1.2, unclear. Increasing memory to 4GB and to 8GB didn't solve the problem. By the way, I have another complaint about PyCharm - when searching, it stopped searching everywhere. Couldn't find where in the config the URL for an environment variable is specified. Eventually, through VSCode search I found this line in pytest config. Smart PyCharm search - no. Such things.

While looking for an answer to the task, accidentally vibed in Gemini, confusing modes. Clicking on Canvas mode, the AI created an application for me instead of answering the query. Funny that we live in times when you can create an application by mistake.

At work, part of the backend is written in Go, it would be cool to look at how things work there, but I remember that I have an unfinished refactoring course from last year, and a list of 10+ books on backend and API to read, so I don't know how to plan time for everything.
