Outcome on the PyCharm problem.

Increasing RAM and increasing swap file didn't help.

Tech support answered my ticket that installation from Flathub is not official, like from any other store, so they can't help with this. Recommended installing from an image from the official site. Of course, I didn't like this thing. Downloading 700MB of editor and installing manually, as if I'm on Windows again, so I decided to look for another option. And it turned out.

Turns out, JetBrains has an official launcher through which you can download, install or update any editor. It's called ToolBox. After this, all editors are downloaded and updated with one click. Why all editors if you only need PyCharm. This is a question for the future, to try Java and PHP. Don't want to download 700MB manually again later, well you get it.

Outcome: after installation through official ToolBox, all freezing bugs disappeared, so I recommend. Besides this, you can see new programs in early access there, turns out, for example, Fleet editor is available there now, it's such a VSCode clone that works with all languages. Of course I don't need it, but it was interesting to look at.

Such a note turned out.
