Today I spent part of the work day on PyCharm. It turned out that the Python debugger crashes, and this hasn't happened before. I haven't found the reason yet, but the case is strange. Spent about 3 hours of the day on this, and had to stay late in the evening because work wasn't working while I was looking for the reason. On the plus side, completed another task, will send it to testing tomorrow. Feedback came on yesterday's task, need to fix something there, also left for tomorrow.

There was also a call about story points in which tasks will need to be estimated, and here's probably a joke about 8+8=13.

Actually, there's a lot of interesting stuff I want to talk about, but I can't talk about it, just know this 😅
