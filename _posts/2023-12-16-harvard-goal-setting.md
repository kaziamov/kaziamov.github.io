Have been running into research on goal setting for a long time, about 10 years ago, and now it came across my eyes again.

Brief essence: Harvard Business School graduates were asked whether they made written goals and a plan to achieve them: 84% didn't set goals at all, 13% set written goals but didn't think through specific plans, 3% of students wrote down goals and specific plans to achieve them.

After 10 years, the 3% of the class who had written goals and plans were earning ten times more than the 97% of their classmates.
