Today I watched several videos on the red platform from different creators who share strategies for choosing niches and approaches to development.

I combined this with my current skills, and I think I will start by choosing the ones that are backend-first. This is my strong side, and I already have professional experience in it. All the videos mentioned "vibe coding" to some extent, and I also joined a few solopreneur chats to see how others are moving along the solo-development path.

The people in those chats, from what I've seen, face the same problems that beginner developers usually have. It seems to me that GenAI multiplies a developer's skills, but only if those skills are not equal to zero.

It's only been one day, but I feel this post should be a bit longer, because at the very least I should write down some thoughts and notes about what I learned today. I'm planning to set up a blog for this, locally and self-hosted, so I don't waste an extra ten dollars a month for hosting and because it's fun.
