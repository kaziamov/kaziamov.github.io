Have wanted to write a post for a long time that not everyone needs to roll into IT (using examples of friends/acquaintances who are already middles/seniors in their professions and generally like it), but advertising that pours from all sources about "go to IT" creates a desire to try. Actually, if the current job is enjoyable, then if you invest the same amount of effort as rolling into IT would take (year-long training 4-8 hours a day), you can boost your career and get much more profit in money in your current niche than when rolling into IT. Here's an already written post from an expert, so my opinion is just in addition.
