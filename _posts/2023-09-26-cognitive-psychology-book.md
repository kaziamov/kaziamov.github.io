Also wanted to share something personal. Started reading a cognitive psychology book again, rereading it for the 3rd-4th time.

I carry this book with me everywhere because it easily and naturally puts my brain back in place when stressful situations happen and all sorts of negative thoughts start to arise in my head. In general, useful. Considering that the weather was also good this week, sitting on a lounge chair and reading is pure pleasure.

Maybe I'm aging or something, but just sitting under the sun with a book, enjoying the wind and the fact that you don't need to rush anywhere. To just enjoy silence and good weather, you usually have to pay extra.
