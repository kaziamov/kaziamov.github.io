Today wanted to share a video on architecture.

I liked this video for the idea, not even about the fact that there's something besides division into monoliths and microservices, but about the fact that in the big picture it's always about encapsulation and layers of abstraction. Pieces of code we write resemble Lego constructor parts from which we can then make either a monolith, or microservice, or the Millennium Falcon.

If after watching you have thoughts, write them in comments.
