Consistency is the key. I try not to give up and publish reports every day, although sometimes, like today, I worked overtime and I'm not sure if today is day 8 or 9.

Actually, I find it hard to understand how my parents worked two or three jobs when I was a child, while I don't have enough time for work and my own project. In moments like these, I realize that I need to try harder, otherwise I won't achieve success.

Tomorrow will be a new day and a new attempt to do everything right.
