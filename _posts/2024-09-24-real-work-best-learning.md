It's now my second year working as a developer, and I understand that the best training is real work.

I would recommend to everyone who is currently learning to find a job as soon as possible after reaching junior level and get hired, rather than trying to take a couple more courses after which you'll finally feel ready. Don't be afraid.

Real work makes the brain think differently, focusing on solving tasks. These aren't just training assignments with made-up rules, but real people's needs, real discussions and finding the best solutions. It's an opportunity to discuss tasks with experienced colleagues and get new ideas, technologies and approaches to solving tasks from them.

This greatly levels you up: in my feeling, three to four months of real work can replace a year of studying courses.

In addition, real work gives the feeling that you don't need to know everything. It's enough to easily find information on the internet. With the advent of ChatGPT, you can calmly make a query and quickly get info from documentation or find a typical solution that can be used. This becomes the cheap part of work. Complex and expensive things in terms of resources are in the area of thinking, where you need to find solutions that would be effective and convenient for end users.

Summarizing everything I said, I recommend getting out to the real market as early as possible and getting hired as developers - then very rapid professional growth will begin.
