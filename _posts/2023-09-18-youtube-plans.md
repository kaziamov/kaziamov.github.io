My YouTube development plans are approximately as follows:

The main channel, which was initially created as instructions for my Python students (yes, I should have told about this in a video about my path into programming), will continue as an educational content channel about Python with a focus on backend.

I have several ideas I'd like to implement on the main channel:
- Lessons for beginners learning Python (because I'm a junior myself and my memories are fresh, I think I can still talk about simple things without flying away too far, because I remember how recently I was confused by them). And need to record while this feeling is still fresh.
- Instructions related to web development. Again, sometimes a 5-minute video is enough to explain how to solve a problem, will continue recording such short videos
- Book club or Brief retelling of books about Python and development. I understand I want to read a lot, and recording videos can not only help someone but also motivate me to read regularly and not slack on it
- Python Friday. Hope this becomes a tradition and can regularly hold online broadcasts about Python and the path in the profession
- Streams on writing projects online. I like writing code, but I think I'm not comfortable doing it on air yet. Perhaps if there's profit from donations, there will be more motivation, but not sure. After all, sitting and stumbling over code when no one sees is much more pleasant.

On the additional channel plans are such:
- Post videos not directly related to programming, such as resume design for a developer, designing a social media page and filling out a LinkedIn profile. About developing your YouTube channel and personal brand. And other such things where I'm not an expert but just experimenting.
- Continue releasing conversational videos in vlog format with minimal editing and not requiring much effort. Such live content that will appeal to those interested in me as a person (would like to know that I'm an interesting person, hehe)
- Possibly also a book section on psychology and self-development, but not sure yet.

As soon as I start feeling confident at work, I'll start implementing my ideas. In general, I have many plans, but everything comes down to time. Most of it is taken by script, filming and editing. Hope I'll learn to do this faster over time.
