In the morning, I continued the same task that I looked at Friday evening. With a fresh look, I understood I went the wrong way. I realized that the logic I need should be somewhere at a higher level. Then it turned out I went the wrong way again, and the error was embarrassingly simple.

Usually at the beginning of the work day, I do a project update to pull updates from git. This time, possibly due to stress, I skipped this step. It turned out a new frontend interface had arrived, and I had the project version from Thursday. After updating, the number of unclear things decreased. By this time, I had already gone through Confluence, read the docs about what cases exist for the current logic, and reviewed all the backend and frontend logic related to this task. I hope this will be useful in the future.

In the second half of the day, I started reading information about the change delivery process, what rules exist for managing a task, naming, and how to deliver all this to the stage. As a result, I seem to have done everything right, but it feels like I missed something because I didn't deploy to the stage. I wrote a question in the work chat, but it didn't send because of some connection problems - either my internet or work VPN. I'll figure this out in the morning.

I can say I'm dissatisfied with my productivity and know I can do better, because replacing one line strangely stretched out for the whole day. Such things.
