In the morning continued the same task that I looked at Friday evening. With a fresh look, understood I went the wrong way. Realized that the logic I need should be somewhere at a higher level. Then it turned out I went the wrong way again, and the error was banally simple.

Usually at the beginning of the work day I do a project update to pull updates from git. This time, possibly due to stress, I skipped this step. It turned out a new frontend interface arrived, and I had the project version from Thursday. After updating, the number of unclear things became less, by this time I had already gone through Confluence, read the docs about what cases exist for current logic, and reviewed all the backend and frontend logic related to this task. Hope this will be useful in the future.

In the second half of the day started reading information about the change delivery process, what rules exist for managing a task, naming, and how to deliver all this to the stage. As a result, I seem to have done everything right, but it feels like I missed something because I didn't deploy to the stage. Wrote a question in the work chat, but it didn't send because of some connection problems, either my internet or work VPN. Will figure this out in the morning.

Can say I'm dissatisfied with my productivity and can do better, because replacing one line strangely stretched out for the whole day. Such things.
