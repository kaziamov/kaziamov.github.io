Haven't written anything for a while, was busy writing code.

Was heavily dealing with tasks at work (not very productively), and on weekends was writing backend for one volunteer project. You could say that after Django at work, I rest with FastAPI. Actually the volunteer project is interesting, I hope it will be in demand and bring benefit to people. I track time, how much I spend on coding and on volunteering I spent about 32-33 hours in two weeks. So essentially on weekends I have like a second job, only unpaid, hah.

At work started gradually understanding what I'm doing in general, before this I was just completing tasks with some kind of Jedi intuition, and now awareness seems to have come, stress left and fear of this huge codebase left.

To rest a bit took on a task to update a PHP testing service, whose repository wasn't used for some time. It happened that I had a task related to this and while working on it, the site where everything was tested crashed. In general, there will be additional exp for farming knowledge about Heroku, deploy and PHP.
