Today I received access and an onboarding plan. The main tasks were to figure out employment documents and install all necessary applications. Also met the team members on a call and agreed to go for coffee on the weekend.

For tomorrow - need to launch the application I'll be working on. I'll be working on an interesting project, already saw live how the pipeline and project build are organized. There's a fairly simple process to understand that runs along a conveyor and assembles builds with new versions of applications that can be tried on available stages.

A bit surprised that the work calendar has special hours allocated for the game the company develops - if I worked in the office, I could play console games during work hours right in the office. Is this common in many gamedev companies? :D

Speaking about myself, there's no fear or worry anymore, there's understanding that it will be unclear ahead, but this is perceived as expected, and will be resolved in the future. From the experience of previous jobs, I understand that I'll find a solution to the problem anyway.

And honestly, it's unusual when I don't have tasks hanging on me. Feels like I'm slacking off from work, although I understand everything with my brain, but that's what the work vibe looks like. Hope to finish onboarding quickly and start writing code already.
