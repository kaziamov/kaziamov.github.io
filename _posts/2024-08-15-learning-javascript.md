The last four months I felt I couldn't learn anymore. I encountered burnout and fatigue, and it was hard for me to do anything new in Python. I focused only on work tasks and didn't open the laptop for personal projects. As a result, I stopped developing, which upset me a lot. I started thinking something was wrong.

Last weekend I started learning JavaScript due to work necessity. And here's what I understood: learning new language syntax comes much easier after a year of working with Python. Some JavaScript concepts complement Python understanding. Studying JavaScript, I discovered new ways to apply these concepts in Python. This involved me so much that I felt a surge of energy and motivation to learn something new.

This experience showed me that perhaps in moments when it seems there's no strength to move forward, it's important not to give up. Need to give yourself time and try something new. This doesn't necessarily have to be another programming language, it can be any new technology. The main thing is to find a way to return strength and motivation for further development.

In general, there's such a phrase about if you can't walk towards the goal, can't walk towards the goal - crawl, can't crawl - just lie in the direction of the goal. And now this phrase gained special meaning, you always need to keep focus on the goal so that as soon as strength appears, start running towards the goal.

In general, I, and with it this blog, are returning to life. Will be glad if you throw reactions on the post and call friends to subscribe to this blog.
