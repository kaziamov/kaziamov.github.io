Today there was a 1+ hour call with the team lead because I had questions about the review. I disagreed with the comments, and I needed to understand how it works in the team and what boundaries I have in decision-making. There were also questions about the testing approach. It turned out to be a very interesting dialogue, I'd like to stay at this company because the level of engineering culture and project organization is really very high. I like it. Also glad that everyone in the team communicates without swearing, I love that.

From Python things, my debugger broke on the Django project and by elimination I figured out it's not in the editor (the problem manifests in VSCode too), and the problem is not with the OS, because another Django project works as intended. It's something specific to the project environment or parameters. Looks like when trying to call anything in the debugger thread, all threads fall with an error (found similar description on Stack Overflow, but without solution).

From activities, streaming still doesn't work out, I get too distracted by chat and communication, but I'd like to work. Most likely I'll introduce this on a regular basis in the format of broadcasts on a given topic. By the way, I'll release the first version of the free Python course soon. On the weekend I'll try to edit everything. Actually, there's enough info on basic Python, but for more complex things you need to be sure that the student has the foundation for this.

Regarding work and moving into IT and job search, my position is: If it didn't work out in a year, it means you're doing something wrong. I don't consult on careers, but simply recommend not taking titles like "you won't find a job in IT in 2025" from bloggers at face value. Good specialists are always needed, whether they're developers or plumbers.

Thanks to everyone who reads and comments, and don't hesitate to write if you want to learn something in more detail, I'll be happy to share.
