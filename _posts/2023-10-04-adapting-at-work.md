Starting to gradually get into the work process. It seems to me that no matter how I thought I didn't have stress, it still was there. Now looking at the same code sections and now everything is understood much easier. Can't deny the importance of adaptation at a new place. I think if not for the help of guys from the team, I'd probably still be stuck on the project. Most surprisingly, no matter how much you sit on a project overtime, understanding comes when stress decreases, and it decreases from communicating with other team members.

If you sit and stare at one thing, you can not figure out the project, not adapt and generally not show what you were capable of. That is, code technically doesn't become simpler, it's what it was and still is, perception becomes better and these are purely human soft skill things. Ability to adapt to changes, communicate and make efforts.

On the topic of soft skills, lots of insights are coming lately. Will try to share.
