I started my career in 2012 working for a small online store in Krasnoyarsk, Siberia. I was fascinated by working with customers and solving picking and delivery challenges.

As an online store manager, I worked in sales and customer service for 2 regional and 3 national online stores for 6 years.

After that, I started looking for ways to work remotely and have more control over my work-life balance, so I began freelancing.

Over time, I reconsidered my career path and realized that I was fascinated by the technical side of e-commerce and wanted to grow as a developer.
