Today I wrote down a list of ideas in the category of things that can be automated and turned into a service. I ended up with 18 ideas (the list of ideas and others can be found at the link in the description, because the post has a character limit).

I also created a spreadsheet to track my expenses. For now, my cash flow is negative. Of course, this doesn't look like typical Instagram content — usually I see posts about 10–50k MRR, but that's not my case.

## The tech stack for my future apps:
- FastAPI/Django + PostgreSQL
- Vue.js
- VPS / Self-Hosted RPi Server + Cloudflare + Docker Compose

Technologies for payments, authentication, and email sending are still undecided.
