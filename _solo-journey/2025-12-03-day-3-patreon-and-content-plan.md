Today I created a page on Patreon for everything related to my income and progress on my solopreneur journey. I will keep my blog for technical articles that are only interesting to developers.

I know that success is waiting for me — maybe in 100 days or maybe in 1,000 — and it would be great if I could find like-minded people along the way. The first YouTube videos will come out this weekend, along with the first code for the project.
