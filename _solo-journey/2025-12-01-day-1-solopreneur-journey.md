Today I decided to focus on my routine and plan how I will move from being a full-time employee to becoming a full-time solopreneur. Since I don't want to give up my developer salary yet, I will work on my own apps in my free time and share the process here on this account. I don't know how long it will take me to find a niche, build an app, and reach an income of $5k per month.

I also decided to archive all the videos on my channel and start again. While creating my apps, I will probably come across useful information for other developers like me, and I want to share it.

Follow me and feel free to ask questions — I'm always happy to talk with like-minded people.

Today I've written a plan for my next steps. I want to continue my YouTube channel.
